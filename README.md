A C++ implementation of neural networks by first principles. This is intended to for educational purposes and not to design a performant production quality library.
We follow the following course from Andrew Ng and implement step by step all the concepts indtroducted during this course
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction
Here are the core principles behind the design of the library
* Keep code as simple as possible
* Use C++ 20+ whenever possible
